## Heter Fast SecureBoost Pipeline Example Usage Guide.

#### Example Tasks

This section introduces the Pipeline scripts for different types of tasks.

1. Train Mix Binary Classification Task:

    script: pipeline-hetero-sbt-mix-binary.py

2. Train Mix Binary Classification Task with prediction:

    script: pipeline-hetero-sbt-mix-binary-with-predict.py

3. Train Mix Multi-class Classification Task:

    script: pipeline-hetero-sbt-mix-multi.py

4. Train Mix Regression Task:

    script: pipeline-hetero-sbt-mix-regression.py
    
5. Train Mix With Multi-host:

    script: pipeline-hetero-sbt-mix-binary-multi-host.py
    
6. Train Layered Binary Classification Task:

    script: pipeline-hetero-sbt-layered-binary.py

7. Train Layered Binary Classification Task with prediction:

    script: pipeline-hetero-sbt-layered-binary-with-predict.py

8. Train Layered Multi-class Classification Task:

    script: pipeline-hetero-sbt-layered-multi.py

Users can run a pipeline job directly:

    python ${pipeline_script}
