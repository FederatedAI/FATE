## Hetero Linear Regression Configuration Usage Guide.

#### Upload data

We have provided several upload config for you can upload example data conveniently.

1. motor_mini set
    1. Guest Party Data: test_hetero_linr_upload_data_guest.json
    2. Host Party Data: test_hetero_linr_upload_data_host.json

    This data set can be applied for train task, train & validation task, cv task and lr with feature engineering task that list below.

#### Example Tasks

This section introduces the dsl and conf for usage of different tasks.

1. Train Task:

    dsl: test_hetero_linr_train_job_dsl.json

    runtime_config : test_hetero_linr_train_job_conf.json

2. Predict Task:

    runtime_config: test_predict_conf.json

3. Validate Task (with early-stopping parameters specified):
    dsl: test_hetero_linr_validate_job_dsl.json

    runtime_config : test_hetero_linr_validate_job_conf.json

4. Cross Validation Task:

    dsl: test_hetero_linr_cv_job_dsl.json

    runtime_config: test_hetero_linr_cv_job_conf.json

5. Multi-host Train Task:

    dsl: test_hetero_linr_train_job_dsl.json

    conf: test_hetero_linr_multi_host_train_job_conf.json

6. Multi-host Cross Validation Task:

    dsl: test_hetero_linr_train_job_dsl.json

    conf: test_hetero_linr_multi_host_cv_job_conf.json

7. Train Task with Sparse Data:
    
     dsl: test_hetero_linr_train_job_dsl.json

    runtime_config : test_hetero_linr_train_sparse_job_conf.json


Users can use following commands to run the task.

    python {fate_install_path}/fate_flow/fate_flow_client.py -f submit_job -c ${runtime_config} -d ${dsl}

After having finished a successful training task, you can use it to predict, you can use the obtained model to perform prediction. You need to add the corresponding model id and model version to the configuration [file](test_predict_conf.json)
