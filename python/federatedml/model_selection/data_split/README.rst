Data Split
==========

Data Split module splits data into desired train, test, and/or validate
sets. The module is based on sklearn train_test_split method while its
output can include an extra validate data set.

Data Split supports homogeneous (both Guest & Host have y) and
heterogeneous (only Guest has y) mode.

The module takes one table input as specified in job config file. Table
must be uploaded beforehand as with other federatedml models. Module
parameters should be specified in job config file. Any parameter
unspecified will take the default value detailed in `parameter
definition <../../param/data_split_param.py>`__.

Data Split module always outputs three tables (train, test, and validate
sets). Each table may be used as input of another module. Below are the
rules regarding set sizes: 1. if all three set sizes are None, the
original data input will be split in the following ratio: 80% to train set,
20% to validate set, and an empty test set; 2. if only test size or validate size is given,
train size is set to be of complement given size; 3. only one of the
three sizes is needed to split input data, but all three may be
specified. The module takes either int (instance count) or float
(fraction) value for set sizes, but mixed-type inputs cannot be used.
