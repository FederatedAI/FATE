# PSI

This module implements PSI(Private Set Intersection)
based on [elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffieâ€“Hellman).
ECDH mode currently uses [Curve25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519),  
which offers 128 bits of security with key size of 256 bits.

Below is an illustration of ECDH intersection.

For details on how to hash value to given curve,
please refer [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-10#section-6.7.1).

Note that starting in ver 2.0.0-beta, data uploaded should always have sample id and match id;
for data sets that originally only contain id, please specify 'extend_sid' in upload config
as in this [example](../../../examples/pipeline/upload/test_upload.py).
