# Intersection

This module provide some method of PSI(Private Set Intersection)

## RSA Intersection

This mode implements algorithm based on [RSA
Intersection](https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=zfvf37_YS8cC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=rsa+commutative+encryption&source=bl&ots=LbOiyIlr3E&sig=IIWlTGeoU0C8dRiN10uH2OAwobQ&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiLoozC1tbXAhVDnJQKHbP7DvAQ6AEIdTAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false).
This work is built on FATE, eggroll and federation API that construct
the secure, distributed and parallel infrastructure.

Our Intersection module tries to solve Privacy-Preserving Entity Match
problem. This module helps two and more parties to find common entry ids
without leaking non-overlapping ids. The process is illustrated below in
<span class="title-ref">figure 1</span>.

![Figure 1 (RSA Intersection between party A and party
B)](../images/rsa_intersection.png)

In <span class="title-ref">figure 1</span> ,Party A has user id
u1,u2,u3,u4, while Party B has u1,u2,u3,u5. After Intersection, party A
and party B both learn their common user ids, which are u1,u2,u3, while
neither party A nor B could decrypt each other's non-overlapping user
ids. Transmission parties' processed id to the other party, like \(Y-A\)
and \(Z-B\), will not reveal raw ids. Processed \(Z-B\) is safe due to
the privacy key of party B. Each \(Y-A\) includes different random value
which binds to each value in \(X-A\) and will be safe as well.

Introduced in FATE version 1.6,
<span class="title-ref">split\_calculation</span> option is available
for improved efficiency. Different from unified process described above,
<span class="title-ref">split\_calculation</span> process first splits
hash-processed ids into even and odd groups; each group then runs
through the RSA intersection process with either host or guest as the
joining role. Note than with
<span class="title-ref">split\_calculation</span>, host(s) always know
about their common even ids with guest since they are responsible for
finding common even ids.

With RSA intersection, participants can get their intersection ids
securely and efficiently.

## RAW Intersection

This mode implements the simple intersection method in which a
participant sends all its ids to another participant, and the other
participant finds their common ids. Finally, the joining role will send
the intersection ids to the sender.

## DH Intersection

This mode implements secure intersection based on symmetric encryption
with Pohligâ€“Hellman commutative cipher. DH Intersection is also used in
[Secure Information Retrieval(SIR)
module](sir.md).

## Intersection With Cache

Intersection may be conducted as online/offline phases. Both RSA and DH
Intersection support cache. 

## Multi-Host Intersection

RSA, RAW, and DH intersection support multi-host scenario. It means a
guest can perform intersection with more than one host simultaneously
and get the common ids among all participants.

![Figure 2 (multi-hosts
Intersection)](../images/multi_host_intersect.png)

Refer to <span class="title-ref">figure 2</span> for a demonstration of
one guest running intersection with two hosts; the same process applies
to cases with more than two hosts. First, guest will run intersection
with each host and get respective overlapping ids. Then, guest will find
common IDs from all intersection results. Optionally, guest will send
common IDs to every host.

## Match ID(Repeated ID) intersection

Starting at ver 1.7, it is recommended to assign random sid to uploaded
data. Intersection module then automatically checks for and process data
with instance ID.

Note that parameters for original repeated ID process such as
``repeated_id_process`` are deprecated in
ver 1.7. Specify ``sample_id_generator`` to the
role whose sid to be kept. For instances, when
``sample_id_generator`` is set to Guest(default),
Guest's data is

    sid, id, value
    123, alice, 2
    125, alice, 3
    130, bob, 4

In Host, you data is

    sid, id, value
    210, alice, 5
    232, alice, 5
    212, bob, 4

After intersection, guest will get the intersection results:

    sid, id, value
    123, alice, 2
    125, alice, 3
    130, bob, 4

And for Host:

    sid, id, value
    123, alice, 5
    125, alice, 5
    130, bob, 4

## Feature

RSA, RAW, and DH intersection methods support:

1.  Multi-host PSI task. The detailed configuration for multi-host task
    can be found
    [here](../tutorial/dsl_conf/dsl_conf_v2_setting_guide.md#multi-host-configuration).
2.  Automatically match ID intersection using ID expanding (when data contains instance id).
3.  Configurable hashing methods, including sha256, md5, and sm3; hash
    operators of RSA intersection can be configured separately, please
    refer [here](../../python/federatedml/param/intersect_param.py)
    for more details.
4.  Preprocessing step to pre-filter Host's data for faster PSI

RAW and DH intersection methods also support:

1.  PSI with cache

RAW intersection supports the following extra feature:

1.  base64 encoding may be used for all hashing methods.

RSA intersection is used for intersection cardinality estimation.
