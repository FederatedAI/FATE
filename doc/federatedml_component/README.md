# Federated Machine Learning

[[中文](README.zh.md)]

FederatedML includes implementation of many common machine learning
algorithms on federated learning. All modules are developed in a
decoupling modular approach to enhance scalability. Specifically, we
provide:

1. Federated Statistic: PSI, Union, Pearson Correlation, etc.
2. Federated Information Retrieval: PIR(SIR) Based OT
3. Federated Feature Engineering: Feature Sampling, Feature Binning,
    Feature Selection, etc.
4. Federated Machine Learning Algorithms: LR, GBDT, DNN,
    TransferLearning, UnsupervisedLearning which support Heterogeneous and Homogeneous
    styles, Semi-supervisedLearning which support Heterogeneous styles
5. Model Evaluation: Binary | Multiclass | Regression | Clustering
    Evaluation, Local vs Federated Comparison.
6. Secure Protocol: Provides multiple security protocols for secure
    multi-party computing and interaction between participants.
