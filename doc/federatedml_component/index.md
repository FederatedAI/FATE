# Federated Machine Learning

[[中文](index.zh.md)]

FederatedML includes implementation of many common machine learning
algorithms on federated learning. All modules are developed in a
decoupling modular approach to enhance scalability. Specifically, we
provide:

1.  Federated Statistic: PSI, Union, Pearson Correlation, etc.
2.  Federated Feature Engineering: Feature Sampling, Feature Binning,
    Feature Selection, etc.
3.  Federated Machine Learning Algorithms: LR, GBDT, DNN,
    TransferLearning, which support Heterogeneous and Homogeneous
    styles.
4.  Model Evaluation: Binary | Multiclass | Regression | Clustering
    Evaluation, Local vs Federated Comparison.
5.  Secure Protocol: Provides multiple security protocols for secure
    multi-party computing and interaction between participants.
