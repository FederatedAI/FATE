## ****FATE Stand-alone Deployment Guide****

The stand-alone version provides 2 deployment methods, which can be selected according to your actual situation:

- Install FATE using Docker [Chinese guide](./doc/Fate-standalone_deployment_guide_zh.md) *(Recommended)* 

- Install FATE  in Host [Chinese guide](./doc/Fate-standalone_deployment_guide_zh.md) 


#### 1) Install FATE using Docker*(Recommended)* 

It is strongly recommended to use docker, which greatly reduces the possibility of encountering problems.

1. The host needs to be able to access the external network,pull the installation package and docker image from the public network.

2. Dependent on [docker](https://download.docker.com/linux/) and [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.24.0), docker recommended version is 18.09, docker-compose recommended version is 1.24.0, you can use the following command to verify the docker environment: docker --version and docker-compose --version, docker start and stop and other Please refer to: docker --help.

3. Check whether the 8080, 9060, and 9080 ports are occupied before executing. If you want to execute again, please delete the previous container and image with the docker command.

   please follow the below step:


```
#Get code
wget https://webank-ai-1251170195.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/docker_standalone-fate-1.4.1.tar.gz
tar -xzvf docker_standalone-fate-1.4.1.tar.gz

#Execute the command
cd docker_standalone-fate-1.4.1
bash install_standalone_docker.sh
```

4. Test

   - Unit Test

   ```
   CONTAINER_ID=`docker ps -aqf "name=fate_python"`
   docker exec -t -i ${CONTAINER_ID} bash
   bash ./federatedml/test/run_test.sh
   ```

   If success,  the screen shows like blow:

   ```
   there are 0 failed test
   ```

   - Toy_example Test

   ```
   CONTAINER_ID=`docker ps -aqf "name=fate_python"`
   docker exec -t -i ${CONTAINER_ID} bash
   python ./examples/toy_example/run_toy_example.py 10000 10000 0
   ```

   If success,  the screen shows like blow:

   ```
   success to calculate secure_sum, it is 2000.0
   ```

   

There are a few algorithms under [examples](../examples/federatedml-1.x-examples) folder, try them out!

#### 2) Install FATE  in Host

1. Check whether the local 8080,9360,9380 port is occupied.

   ```
   netstat -apln|grep 8080
   netstat -apln|grep 9360
   netstat -apln|grep 9380
   ```

2. Download the compressed package of stand-alone version and decompress it.

   ```
   wget https://webank-ai-1251170195.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/standalone-fate-master-1.4.1.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf  standalone-fate-master-1.4.1.tar.gz
   ```

3. Enter FATE directory and execute the init.sh.

   ```
   cd standalone-fate-master-1.4.1
   source init.sh init
   ```

4. Test

   - Unit Test

   ```
   cd standalone-fate-master-1.4.1
   bash ./federatedml/test/run_test.sh
   ```

   If success,  the screen shows like blow:

   ```
   there are 0 failed test
   ```

   - Toy_example Test

   ```
   cd standalone-fate-master-1.4.1
   python ./examples/toy_example/run_toy_example.py 10000 10000 0
   ```

   If success,  the screen shows like blow:
