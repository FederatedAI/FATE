FATE FLOW
=========

Introduction
-------------

FATE-Flow is a end to end pipeline platform for Federated Learning.
Pipeline is a sequence of components which is specifically designed for
highly flexible, high performance federated learning tasks. That
includes data processing, modeling, training, verification, publishing
and serving inference.

   FATE-Flow Federated Learning Pipeline

FATE-Flow now supports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  DAG define Pipeline
-  Describe DAG using **FATE-DSL** in **JSON** format
-  FATE has a large number of default federated learning components,
   such as Hetero LR/Homo LR/Secure Boosting Tree and so on.
-  Developers can easily implement custom components using Basic-API and
   build their own Pipeline through DSL.
-  Federated Modeling Task Life-cycle Manager, start/stop, status
   synchronization and so on.
-  Powerful Federated Scheduler, support multiple scheduling strategies
   for DAG Job and Component Task.
-  Real-time tracking of data, parameters, models, and metric during the
   experiment.
-  Federated Model Manager, model binding, versioning and deployment
   tools.
-  Provide HTTP API and Command Line Interface.
-  Data and interface support for modeling visualization on
   **FATE-Board**.

   DSL Example

Write a DSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only one step is required to configure a component for pipeline.

-  define the module of this component
-  define the input, includes data, model or isometric_model(only be
   used for FeatureSelection)
-  define the output, includes data and model

Deploy
------

Fate-flow is deployed in ``$PYTHONPATH/fate_flow/``. It depends on two
configuration files: ``$PYTHONPATH/arch/conf/server.conf``,
``$PYTHONPATH/fate_flow/settings.py``

:server.conf:
   Server.conf configures the address of all FATE services. FATE-Flow of different deployment modes needs different fate services. For details, please refer to the following specific deployment mode.

Usage
-----

FATE-Flow provide `REST API <./doc/fate_flow_rest_api.rst>`__ and
`Command Line Interface <./doc/fate_flow_cli.rst>`__. Let’s start using
the client to run a Federated Learning Pipeline Job
example(**Standalone**).

Offline Modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:Upload Data(guest/host):


    .. code:: bash

       python fate_flow_client.py -f upload -c examples/upload_guest.json
       python fate_flow_client.py -f upload -c examples/upload_host.json

    .. Note::

       The configuration item **USE_LOCAL_DATA** in FATE-Flow Server represents
       whether to use the data on the FATE-Flow client machine when uploading
       data, and the default is use(True). If the configuration
       **USE_LOCAL_DATA** of FATE-Flow Server is set to **True**, and you still
       want to use the data on the machine where the FATE-Flow Server is
       located, you can add it to the upload configuration "**module**" parameter, the parameter value 0(default is 1).

    .. Note::

       When the cluster deployment uses the same
       table to upload data, it is necessary to carry the **drop** parameter (0
       represents overwriting upload, 1 represents deleting the previous data
       and re-uploading)

    .. code:: bash

       python fate_flow_client.py -f upload -c examples/upload_guest.json -drop 0

:Submit Job:

   .. code:: bash

      python fate_flow_client.py -f submit_job -d examples/test_hetero_lr_job_dsl.json -c examples/test_hetero_lr_job_conf.json

   Command response example:

   .. code:: json

      {
          "data": {
              "board_url": "http://localhost:8080/index.html#/dashboard?job_id=2019121910313566330118&role=guest&party_id=9999",
              "job_dsl_path": "xxx/jobs/2019121910313566330118/job_dsl.json",
              "job_runtime_conf_path": "xxx/jobs/2019121910313566330118/job_runtime_conf.json",
              "logs_directory": "xxx/logs/2019121910313566330118",
              "model_info": {
                  "model_id": "arbiter-10000#guest-9999#host-10000#model",
                  "model_version": "2019121910313566330118"
              }
          },
          "jobId": "2019121910313566330118",
          "retcode": 0,
          "retmsg": "success"
      }

   Some of the following operations will use these response information.

:Query Job:

.. code:: bash

   python fate_flow_client.py -f query_job -r guest -p 10000 -j $job_id

   And then, you can found so many useful command from `CLI <./doc/fate_flow_cli.rst>`__.

   For more Federated Learning pipeline Job example, please refer at `federatedml-1.x-examples <./../examples/federatedml-1.x-examples>`__ and it’s `README <./../examples/federatedml-1.x-examples/README.rst>`__

Online Inference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Publish model to **FATE-Serving**, and then using Serving’s GRPC API to
inference.

:Modify service configuration:

   Modify the IP and end of **FATE-Serving** in
   **arch/conf/server_conf.json** (please note that many parties need to
   modify the actual deployment address of their respective
   **FATE-Serving**), the content is “servings”:[“ip: port”], restart
   **FATE-Flow** after modification. server_conf.json format is as follows:

   .. code:: json

      {
          "servers": {
              "servings": [
                  "127.0.0.1:8000"
              ]
          }
      }

:Publish Model:

   .. code:: bash

      python fate_flow_client.py -f load -c examples/publish_load_model.json

   Please replace the corresponding configuration in
   ``publish_load_model.json`` with your job configuration. After that, you
   can make online inference request to FATE-Serving by specifying the
   model id and model version used.

:Publish Model Online Default:

   .. code:: bash

      python fate_flow_client.py -f bind -c examples/bind_model_service.json

   Please replace the corresponding configuration in
   ``publish_online_model.json`` with your job configuration. After that,
   the FATE-Serving uses the configuration you provided to set the party’s
   default model id and the default model version that involves the model
   id. And then, will you can make online inference request to FATE-Serving
   by only specifying the party_id or the model id.

FAQ
------

:What is the role of FATE FLOW in the FATE?:

   FATE Flow is a scheduling system that schedules the execution of
   algorithmic components based on the DSL of the job submitted by the
   user.

:ModuleNotFoundError: No module named “arch”:

   Set PYTHONPATH to the parent directory of fate_flow.

:Why does the task show success when submitting the task, but the task fails on the dashboard page?:

   -  Submit success just means that the job was submitted and not
      executed. If the job fails, you need to check the log.
   -  You can view the logs through the board.

:What meaning and role do the guest, host, arbiter, and local roles represent in fate?:

   -  Arbiter is used to assist multiple parties to complete joint
      modeling. Its main role is to aggregate gradients or models. For
      example, in vertical lr, each party sends half of its gradient to
      arbiter, and then arbiter jointly optimizes, etc.
   -  Guest represents the data application party.
   -  Host is the data provider.
   -  Local refers to local, only valid for upload and download.

:Error about“cannot find xxxx” when killing a waiting job:

   Fate_flow currently only supports kill on the job initiator, kill will report “cannot find xxx”.

:What is the upload data doing?:

   Upload data is uploaded to eggroll and becomes a DTable format executable by subsequent algorithms.

:How to download the generated data in the middle of the algorithm?:

   You can use
      ``python fate_flow_client.py -f component_output_data -j $job_id -r $role -p $party_id -cpn $component_name -o $output_path``

:If the same file upload is executed twice, will fate delete the first data and upload it again?:

   It will be overwritten if the keys are the same in the same table.

:What is the reason for the failure of this job without error on the board?:

   The logs in these places will not be displayed on the
   board:``$job_id/fate_flow_schedule.log``, ``logs/error.log``,
   ``logs/fate_flow/ERROR.log`` .

:What is the difference between the load and bind commands?:

   Load can be understood as a model release, and bind is the default
   model version.
