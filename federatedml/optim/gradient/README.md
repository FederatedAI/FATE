## Linear Model Gradient Introduction

Currently, we support hetero-lr, homo-lr, hetero-linear regression and hetero-poisson regression. In this folder, we use a unified gradient calculation process template for all hetero linear algorithms.

We also provide a quansi-newton method for hetero-lr and hetero-linear regression.
