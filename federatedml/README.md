### Federated Machine Learning

Federatedml includes implementation of many common machine learning algorithms as well as necessary utility tools. All modules are developed in a decoupling modular approach to enhance scalability. Specifically, we provide:

1. FML Algorithms: Federated machine learning algorithms serving for DataIO, Data-preprocessing, feature engineering and modeling. More details are listed below.

2. Utilities: Tools that enable federated learning such as encryption tools, statistic modules, parameter definitions, and transfer variable autogenerator etc.

3. Framework: Kits and base models for developing new algorithm modules. Framework provides reusable functions to standardize modules and make them compact.
