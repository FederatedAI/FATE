### Federated Machine Learning
This module provides various federated machine learning algorithms for users. 

### Algorithm List

#### 1. DataIO
This component is typically the first component of a modeling task. It will transform user-uploaded date into Instance object which can be used for the following components.

Corresponding module name: DataIO

Data Input: DTable, values are raw data.
Data Output: Transformed DTable, values are data instance define in federatedml/feature/instance.py

#### 2. Intersect
Compute intersect data set of two parties without leakage of difference set information. Mainly used in hetero scenario task.

Corresponding module name: Intersection

Data Input: DTable
Data Output: DTable which keys are occurred in both parties.

#### 3. Federated Sampling
Federated Sampling data so that its distribution become balance in each party.This module support both federated and standalone version

Corresponding module name: FederatedSample

Data Input: DTable
Data Output: the sampled data, supports both random and stratified sampling.

#### 4. Feature Scale
Module for feature scaling and standardization.

Corresponding module name: FeatureScale

Data Input: DTable, whose values are instances.
Data Output: Transformed DTable.
Model Output: Transform factors like min/max, mean/std.

#### 5. Hetero Feature Binning
With binning input data, calculates each column's iv and woe and transform data according to the binned information.

Corresponding module name: HeteroFeatureBinning

Data Input: DTable with y in guest and without y in host.
Data Output: Transformed DTable.
Model Output: iv/woe, split points, event counts, non-event counts etc. of each column.

#### 6. OneHot Encoder
Transfer a column into one-hot format.

Corresponding module name: OneHotEncoder
Data Input: Input DTable.
Data Output: Transformed DTable with new headers.
