# Heterogeneous Neural Networks 

Neural networks are probably the most popular machine learning algorithms in recent years. FATE provides a federated Heterogeneous neural network implementation.

This federated heterogeneous neural network framework allows multiple parties to jointly conduct a learning process with partially overlapping user samples but different feature sets, which corresponds to a vertically partitioned virtual data set. An 
advantage of Hetero NN is that it provides the same level of accuracy as the non privacy-preserving approach while 
at the same time, reveal no information of each private data provider.

 
## Basic FrameWork

The following figure shows the proposed Federated Heterogeneous Neural Network framework.

Party B: We define the party B as the data provider who holds both a data matrix and the class label. Since the class label information is indispensable for supervised learning, there must be an party with access to the label y.
The party B naturally takes the responsibility as a dominating server in federated learning. 

Party A: We define the data provider which has only a data matrix as party A. Party A plays the role of clients in the federated learning setting. 

The data samples are aligned under an encryption scheme. By using the privacy-preserving protocol for inter-database intersections, the parties can 
 find  their common users or data samples without compromising the non-overlapping parts of the data sets.

Party B and party A each have their own bottom neural network model, which may be different.
The parties jointly build the interactive layer, which is a fully connected layer. This layer's input is the concatenation of the two parties' bottom model output. 
In addition, only party B owns the model of interactive layer. Lastly, party B builds the top neural network model and feeds the output of interactive layer to it.


## Forward Propagation of Federated Heterogeneous Neural Network 
Forward Propagation Process consists of three parts.

Part Ⅰ: Forward Propagation of Bottom Model.
1. Party A feeds its input features X to its bottom model and gets the forward output of bottom model alpha_A
2. Party B feeds its input features X to its bottom model and gets the forward output of bottom model alpha_B if active party has input features.

Part ⅠⅠ: Forward Propagation of Interactive Layer.
1. Party A uses additive homomorphic encryption to encrypt alpha_A(mark as [alpha _A] ), and sends the encrypted result to party B.

2. Party B receives the [alpha_A], multiplies it by interactive layer's party A model weight W_A, get [z_A].  
   Party B also multiplies its interactive layer's weight W_B by its own bottom output, getting z_B.  
   Party B generates noise epsilon_B, adds it to [z_A] and sends addition result to party A.
   
3. Party A calculates the product of accumulate noise epsilon_acc and bottom input alpha_A (epsilon_acc * alpha_A). Decrypting the received result [z_A + epsilon_B], Party A adds the product to it and sends result to Active party.

4. Party B subtracts the party A's sending value by epsilon_B( get z_A + epsilon_acc * alpha_A), and feeds z = z_A + epsilon_acc * alpha_A + z_B(if exists) to activation function. 

Part ⅠⅠⅠ: Forward Propagation of Top Model.
1. Party B takes the output of activation function's output of interactive layer g(z) and runs the forward process of top model.

## Backward Propagation of Federated Heterogeneous Neural Network 

Backward Propagation Process also consists of three parts.

Part I: Backward Propagation of Top Model.
1. Party B calculates the error delta of interactive layer output, then updates top model.

Part II: Backward Propagation of Interactive layer.
1. Party B calculates the error delta_act of activation function's output by delta.  
2. Party B propagates delta_bottomB = delta_act * W_B to bottom model, then updates W_B(W_B -= eta * delta_act * alpha_B).
3. Party B generates noise epsilon_B, calculates [delta_act * (W_A + epsilon_B] and sends it to party A.
4. Party A encrypts epsilon_acc, sends [epsilon_acc] to party B.  
   Then party B decrypts the received value, generates noise epsilon_A, adds epsilon_A / eta to decrypted result(delta_act * W_A + epsilon_B + epsilon_A / eta) and epsilon_A to accumulate noise epsilon_acc(epsilon_acc += epsilon_A). Party A sends the addition result to party B. (delta_act * W_A + epsilon_B + epsilon_A / eta)  
5. Party B receives [epsilon_acc] and delta_act * W_A + epsilon_B + epsilon_A / eta. Firstly it sends party A's bottom model output' error [alpha_A * W_A + acc] to host. 
   Secondly updates W_A -= eta * (delta_act * W_A + epsilon_B + epsilon_A / eta) - epsilon_B = eta * delta_act * W_A - epsilon_B = W_TRUE - epsilon_acc. Where W_TRUE represents the actually weights.  
6. Party A decrypts [alpha_A * (W_A + acc)] and passes alpha_A * (W_A + acc) to its bottom model.


Part III: Backward Propagation of Bottom Model.
1. Party B and party A updates their bottom model separately.
