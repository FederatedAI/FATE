## 1. General Introduction

### 1.1 System Introduction

------

1）FATE

FATE (Federated AI Technology Enabler) is an open source project initiated by the AI department of WeBank. It provides a secure computing framework based on data privacy protection and provides strong secure computing support for machine learning, deep learning, and migration learning algorithms. The security bottom layer supports a variety of multi-party secure computer mechanisms such as homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, and hashing. The algorithm layer supports logistic regression, boosting, and federated migration learning in the multi-party secure computing mode.

2）EggRoll

Eggroll is a large-scale distributed architecture suitable for machine learning and deep learning, including computing, storage and communication modules. Provide bottom support for FATE framework.

## 2.Detailed Design

### 2.1.Deployment Planning

------

In this example, there is only one host on each end, and multiple hosts on each end. Currently, only nodemanager multi-node deployment is supported, and other components are single-node.

| Role  | Partyid | Ip Address                    | Operating System        | Host Configuration | Storage | Deployment Module                                            |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HOST  | 10000   | 192.168.0.1(Can be networked) | CentOS 7.2/Ubuntu 18.04 | 8C16G              | 500G    | fate_flow，fateboard，clustermanager，nodemanger，rollsite，mysql |
| Guest | 9999    | 192.168.0.2                   | CentOS 7.2/Ubuntu 18.04 | 8C16G              | 500G    | fate_flow，fateboard，clustermanager，nodemanger，rollsite，mysql |

**Remarks:Involving exchange instructions will use 192.168.0.88 to represent its IP, but this example does not involve exchange deployment.**

### 2.2.Host Resources And Operating System Requirements

| Category           | Description                                                  |

**Target server (192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2) root user execution**

When used in a production environment, 128G of virtual memory needs to be added for memory calculations. Check whether the storage space is sufficient before execution.

Note: dd takes a long time to execute, please be patient

```
cd /data
dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/swapfile128G bs=1024 count=134217728
mkswap /data/swapfile128G
swapon /data/swapfile128G
cat /proc/swaps
echo '/data/swapfile128G swap swap defaults 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
```

### 3.7 Install Dependent Packages

------

**Target server (192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2) root user execution**

```
#Install basic dependencies

yum install -y gcc gcc-c++ make openssl-devel gmp-devel mpfr-devel libmpc-devel libaio numactl autoconf automake libtool libffi-devel
#ubuntu
apt-get install -y gcc g++ make openssl libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev libaio1 libaio-dev numactl autoconf automake libtool libffi-dev
#If there is an error, you need to solve the yum source problem.

#Install ansible and process management dependency packages
#centos
yum install -y ansible
#ubuntu
apt-get install -y ansible

#If there is an error and the server has an external network, there is no need to solve the problem of incomplete yum source, execute:
#centos
yum install -y epel-release
#Add a more comprehensive third-party source, and then reinstall ansible jq supervisor
```

ls -ld /data/projects/snmp

#Check the supervisord configuration file, if any, you need to mv or delete it
ls -lrt /data/projects/common/supervisord/supervisord.d/fate-*.conf
```

### 4.3 Obtain The Project

------

**Execute under the app user of the target server (192.168.0.1 with external network environment)**

Enter the /data/projects/ directory of the execution node and execute:

```
#Note: URL links have line breaks, please make sure to arrange them in one line when copying
cd /data/projects/
wget https://webank-ai-1251170195.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/ansible_nfate_1.6.0_release-1.0.0.tar.gz
tar xzf ansible_nfate_1.6.0_release-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

### 4.4 Configuration File Modification And Example

------

#### 4.4.1 Initial Configuration File

```
cd ansible-nfate-*
#init.sh file does not need to be modified, mainly to assist in generating some configuration files
 
#Production environment plus prod parameter execution
  sh ./tools/init.sh prod
 
>sh ./tools/init.sh prod
clean old config
init environments/prod
init var_files/prod
init project_prod.yml
```

#### 4.4.2 Certificate Production Configuration (optional)

**1) Certificate Production**

```
vi /data/projects/ansible-nfate-1.*/tools/make.sh

#1. The custom security certificate needs to be deployed at both ends at the same time, and only one end needs to be manually processed. The manual processing part will not be introduced temporarily.
#2. The security certificate supports the following deployment methods:
     1) Deploy host+guest, host and guest use secure certificate communication.
     2) Deploy host+exchange+guest, where host and exchange use secure certificates to communicate, and guest and exchange communicate normally.
     3) Deploy host+exchange+guest, where guest and exchange use secure certificates to communicate, and host and exchange communicate normally.

guest_host="192.168.0.1" ---Modify according to the actual IP
host_host="192.168.0.2" ---Modify according to the actual IP
exchange_host="192.168.0.88" --- Modify according to the actual IP, this example does not need to be modified without deployment
```

**2) Execute Script To Make Certificate**

```
cd tools
sh ./make.sh

Certificate files will be generated in the keys/host and guest directories.
```

**3) Copy The Certificate To The Deployment Directory**

```
sh cp-keys.sh host guest

The certificate file will be copied to the roles/eggroll/files/keys directory

Special Note:
1. Currently, script deployment only supports 2 parties to set up certificate authentication. (host&guest, host&exchange, guest&exchange)
```

#### 4.4.3 Modify Configuration File

1) **ModifyThe Initialization Host IP**

```
vi /data/projects/ansible-nfate-1.*/environments/prod/hosts

#ansible format configuration file
[fate] ---Fill the host IP to be deployed into the fate group
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2

[deploy_check] --- Fill in the deploy_check group with the local IP that executes ansible
192.168.0.1

[all:vars]
ansible_connection=ssh
ansible_ssh_port=22 --- Modify according to actual situation
ansible_ssh_user=app
#ansible_ssh_pass=test ---If you have not done a password-free login, you need to provide a password
##method: sudo or su
ansible_become_method=sudo
ansible_become_user=root
ansible_become_pass= --- If each host has not done secret-free sudo, the root password must be filled
```

2) **Modify The Deployment Mode**

```
vi /data/projects/ansible-nfate-1.*/var_files/prod/fate_init

#Only modify the following parameters, other parameters remain unchanged by default
deploy_mode: "install" --- The default is empty, modified to install, which means a new deployment
```

**3) Modify Host Side Parameters**

**Note: The default is not to enable the configuration of the security certificate. If you enable the security certificate communication, you need to set server_secure, client_secure, is_secure to true, and the port corresponding to is_secure to 9371**

```
#If you don't deploy host, you don't need to modify
#Except nodemanger can set multiple IPs, all others are single IP

```

### 4.5 Deployment

**After modifying the corresponding configuration items according to the above configuration meaning, then execute the deployment script:**

```
#Relative ansible-nfate-* directory
cd /data/projects/ansible-nfate-1.*
 
#Production environment plus prod parameter execution
nohup sh ./boot.sh prod -D> logs/boot.log 2>&1 &
```

**The deployment log is output in the logs directory, and check whether there is an error in real time:**

```
#Relative ansible-nfate-* directory
cd logs
tail -f ansible.log (check the deployment in real time, if there is no such log file, you need to check whether ansible is installed)

List of check items fail prompt:
1. "Warning: now swap is 0, need to turn up"
    ---The virtual memory is not set, please refer to the previous chapter to set it, not less than 128G.
2. "Warning: key fate process exists, please has a check and clean"
    ---The environment has not been cleaned up, and the previously deployed fate process needs to be stopped.
3. "Warning: these ports: 4670 4671 9360 9370 9380 have been used"
    ---The environment has not been cleaned up, and the previously deployed fate process needs to be stopped.
4. "Warning: if reinstall mysql, please stop mysql, and rename /etc/my.cnf"
    ---mysql did not stop, it needs to be stopped. If there is a /etc/my.cnf file, mv needs to be renamed.
5. "Waring: please rename /data/projects/fate"
    ---The fate directory exists, you need to mv first.
6. "Warning: please rename /data/projects/data/fate/mysql"
    ---/data/projects/data exists, mv is required.
7. "Warning: supervisor_fate_conf exists, please remove ls /data/projects/common/supervisord/supervisord.d/fate-*.conf"
  --- The /data/projects/common directory exists, and mv is required.
```

**Restart after fateflow deployment:**

```
#Because fate_flow depends on more components, there may be exceptions in startup. The processing is as follows:
netstat -tlnp | grep 9360
If there is no port, restart fateflow:
sh service.sh stop fate-fateflow
sh service.sh start fate-fateflow
```

## 5.Test

## 5.1 Toy_example Deployment Verification

For this test you need to set 3 parameters: guest_partyid, host_partyid, work_mode.

### 5.1.1 Unilateral Test

**1) Execute on 192.168.0.1, guest_partyid and host_partyid are both set to 10000:**

```
source /data/projects/fate/bin/init_env.sh
cd /data/projects/fate/examples/toy_example/
python run_toy_example.py 10000 10000 1
```

Note: If there is no output for more than 1 minute, it indicates that there is a problem with the deployment. You need to look at the log to locate the problem.

A result similar to the following indicates success:

"2020-04-28 18:26:20,789-secure_add_guest.py[line:126]-INFO: success to calculate secure_sum, it is 1999.9999999999998"

**2) Execute on 192.168.0.2, guest_partyid and host_partyid are both set to 9999:**

```
source /data/projects/fate/bin/init_env.sh
cd /data/projects/fate/examples/toy_example/
python run_toy_example.py 9999 9999 1
```

Note: If there is no output for more than 1 minute, it indicates that there is a problem with the deployment. You need to look at the log to locate the problem.

A result similar to the following indicates success:

"2020-04-28 18:26:20,789-secure_add_guest.py[line:126]-INFO: success to calculate secure_sum, it is 1999.9999999999998"

### 5.1.2 Bilateral Testing

**Select 9999 as the guest and execute on 192.168.0.2:**

```
source /data/projects/fate/bin/init_env.sh
cd /data/projects/fate/examples/toy_example/
python run_toy_example.py 9999 10000 1
```

A result similar to the following indicates success:

"2020-04-28 18:26:20,789-secure_add_guest.py[line:126]-INFO: success to calculate secure_sum, it is 1999.9999999999998"

## 5.2 Minimize Test

### 5.2.1 Upload Preset Data:

**Execute on 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 respectively:**

```
source /data/projects/fate/bin/init_env.sh
cd /data/projects/fate/examples/scripts/
python upload_default_data.py -m 1
```

**For more details, please refer to**[Script README](../examples/scripts/README.rst)

### 5.2.2 Fast Mode:

Please make sure that both the guest and host have uploaded the preset data through the given script.

In the fast mode, the minimization test script will use a relatively small data set, that is, the breast data set containing 569 data.

**Select 9999 as the guest and execute on 192.168.0.2:**

```
source /data/projects/fate/bin/init_env.sh
cd /data/projects/fate/examples/toy_example/
#Unilateral test
python run_task.py -m 1 -gid 9999 -hid 9999 -aid 9999 -f fast
#Bilateral test
python run_task.py -m 1 -gid 9999 -hid 10000 -aid 10000 -f fast
```

Some other parameters that may be useful include:

1. -f: File type used. "fast" represents the breast data set, and "normal" represents the default credit data set.
2. --add_sbt: If it is set to 1, the secureboost task will be started after lr is run. If it is set to 0, the secureboost task will not be started. If this parameter is not set, the system defaults to 1.

If the word "success" is displayed in the result after a few minutes, it indicates that the operation has run successfully. If "FAILED" appears or the program is stuck, it means the test has failed.

### 5.2.3 Normal Mode

Just replace "fast" with "normal" in the command, and the rest is the same as in fast mode.

## 5.3 Fateboard Testing

Fateboard is a web service. If the fateboard service is successfully started, you can view the task information by visiting http://192.168.0.1:8080 and http://192.168.0.2:8080. If there is a firewall between the local office computer and the server, you need to enable it.

## 6.System Operation And Maintenance

### 6.1 Service Management

------

**Execute under the target server (192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2) app user**

### 6.1.1 Service Management

```
cd /data/projects/common/supervisord
```

Start/Stop/Restart/View all:

```
#Note: Because mysql is a basic component, the startup is slow. It is recommended to restart all components first, then start mysql first, and then start other components
sh service.sh start/stop/restart/status all

#Note: Because fateflow depends on many components, restarting all operations may cause fateflow to start abnormally. The processing is as follows:
netstat -tlnp | grep 9360
If there is no port, restart fateflow:
sh service.sh stop fate-fateflow
sh service.sh start fate-fateflow
```

Start/stop/restart/view a single module (optional: clustermanager, nodemanager, rollsite, fateflow, fateboard, mysql):

```
sh service.sh start/stop/restart/status fate-clustermanager
```

## 6.2 View Process And Port

**Execute under the target server (192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2) app user**

### 6.2.1 View Process

```
#Check whether the process is started according to the deployment plan
ps -ef | grep -i clustermanager
ps -ef | grep -i nodemanager
ps -ef | grep -i rollsite
ps -ef | grep -i fate_flow_server.py
ps -ef | grep -i fateboard
```

### 6.2.2 View Process Port

```

## 8. Appendix

## 8.1 Eggroll Parameter Tuning

Configuration file path: /data/projects/fate/eggroll/conf/eggroll.properties

Configuration parameter: eggroll.session.processors.per.node

Assuming that the number of CPU cores (cpu cores) is c, the number of Nodemanagers is n, and the number of tasks that need to run simultaneously is p, then:

egg_num=eggroll.session.processors.per.node = c * 0.8 / p

partitions (roll pair partition number) = egg_num * n
