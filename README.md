FATE (Federated AI Technology Enabler) is the world's first industrial grade federated learning open source framework to enable enterprises and institutions to collaborate on data while protecting data security and privacy. 
It implements secure computation protocols based on homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation (MPC). 
Supporting various federated learning scenarios, FATE now provides a host of federated learning algorithms, including logistic regression, tree-based algorithms, deep learning and transfer learning.


FATE is an open source project hosted by Linux Foundation. The [Technical Charter](https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE-Community/blob/master/FATE_Project_Technical_Charter.pdf) sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the FATE (“Federated AI Technology Enabler”) Project.

## Getting Started

FATE can be deployed on a single host or on multiple nodes. Choose the deployment approach which matches your environment.
[Release version can be downloaded here.](https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE/wiki/Download)

### Standalone deployment 
- Deploying FATE on a single node via pre-built docker images, installers or source code. It is for simple testing purposes. Refer to this [guide](./deploy/standalone-deploy/).

### Cluster deployment
Deploying FATE to multiple nodes to achieve scalability, reliability and manageability.

- [Cloud native deployment by KubeFATE](https://github.com/FederatedAI/KubeFATE): Deploying and managing a FATE cluster by either Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
- [Cluster deployment by CLI](./deploy/cluster-deploy): Using CLI to deploy a FATE cluster.
- [Deployment by Ansible](https://github.com/FederatedAI/AnsibleFATE): Automating the deployment of a FATE cluster by Ansible.
